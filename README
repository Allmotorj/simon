## Introduction (By Instructor)

This **Introduction** section will be read in class by the instructor.

Students will be self-directed beginning with the **Instructions & Time Guidelines** section below.

### GOAL

The goal of this project assessment is to gauge your ability to develop a **minimal** front-end web application using HTML, CSS & JavaScript, including your ability to:

- Write HTML that provides the application's overall structure and content. 
- Use CSS to provide styling.
- Use JavaScript to:
	- Define variables that hold application state, cache DOM elements, etc.
	- Select elements in the DOM.
	- Listen for browser events, such as `click`, being dispatched by DOM elements.
	- Manipulate a DOM element's content and style. 

### DEMO

The instructor will now demonstrate the app you will be building.

### OVERALL APPLICATION REQUIREMENTS

As you saw, the application's UI consists of:

- A count display
- Two buttons ("+" & "-")
- An `<input>` element
